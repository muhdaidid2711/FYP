Real Time Sign Language Recognition Using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

1. Open you command prompt to open jupyter notebook
2. Open file "REAL TIME SIGN LANGUAGE RECOGNITION USING CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK"
3. For training run line 1 until 38 (which is until you save the model)
4. For testing the model run line 39 until 54
5. The last line of the code is for the real time recongition
